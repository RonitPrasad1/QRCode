Simple and fun QR code project done in Python that essentially allows you to store whatever you desire in the URL link and then generates a QR code as a png in the specified pathing, shown here:
      
    generatedImage.save(r'C:\Users\ronit\PycharmProjects\QRCodeProject\secure_QRCode.png')

Saves the QR code called "secure_QRCode" in the directory where you created your QR code project to begin with. In my case, I have my Resume stored in the QR code, so as soon as you scan it, it'll open up a Google Drive with my 1-page Software Engineering Resume.

Overall, the code is written using correct programming practices, such as wrapping the code in a function, using if __name__ == "__main__" for singular file execution, error handling, comments (single & multi), correct syntax & semantics, variable name, and a return type for the function.
